# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I have coded the game rock paper scissors game using basic python, using loops, using try and except & using class. 
Rock paper scissors is a most popular hand-game played by 2 people. It follows the following rules:
1. closed wrist indicates rock
2. open hand indicates paper 
3. peace symbol in horizontal position indicates scissors
4. if both the people put the same object then its a tie
5. paper wraps rock, giving a point to paper
6. rock smashes scissors, giving a point to rock
7. scissors cuts paper into tiny particals, giving a point to scissors
8. person with more points at the end of game wins!
